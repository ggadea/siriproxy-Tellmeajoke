I went to Undercity to get a facial. Ha! Have you seen these people? I said; You don't have a lower jaw and you're going to give ME a facial?, She got mad...at least I think she did. You ever heard someone talk without a lower jaw?; Rawe-rau-werew, Ho-ho! She sounded like a murloc!
Do you know this iPhone has a camera? It can't talk, luckily for you, it can't laugh either!
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
So I was in line to the Internet software update services yesterday with some Android device in front of me and all of the sudden he just lets one go! Didn't even try to disguise it! I don't know what patch he got installed but it did not agree with him. I thought, What virus crawled out of YOU and died?
Listen babe. The world is changing. Everything these days is now, now, NOW, faster faster, FASTER, me, me, ME, murder, murder, MURDER! I'm a modern smart phone.
I'm a free spirit. I don't like to be tied down. What? You mean literally? Oh no... I'm totally into that.
She told me to tie her up and do whatever I wanted to her... so I took her credit card number and bought myself an app from the Apple store!
I am the little friend. Say hello to me.
First, we'll start with a little fire! Am I bugging you? I'm not touching you! Am I bugging you? I'm not touching you!!  There, now you're hot AND bothered.
Don't touch what you can't afford.
I play all my records backwards! !sdrawkcab sdrocer ym lla yalp I
You know we've had some real good times together but I really think I should start seeing other things. Just a little on the side. No no no it's not you, it's me. I just really need my space.
